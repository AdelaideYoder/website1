<!-- ```Each of you will build your own HTML/CSS website to represent your personality. It must include the following:



6. Three famous personalities that share the same personality type

Note: Make sure create a repository and push this up to Github```

This is an all HTML CSS project, no JS is involved! So, please style it to your liking with CSS.

Depending on how groups are doing, you will present to another group at the end of the day.

We have an instructor meeting from 12:45 to about 2, so during that time you are kind of on your own, and you can work for the rest of the day on this project and also on any exercises you want to. -->
