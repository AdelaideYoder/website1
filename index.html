<!-- ```Each of you will build your own HTML/CSS website to represent your personality. It must include the following:



4. A list of the strengths and weaknesses for the personality type
5. At least five important points you want people who will be interacting and communicating with you to know(from your earlier group discussion)
6. Three famous personalities that share the same personality type

Note: Make sure create a repository and push this up to Github```

This is a hybrid project! Individual but in a group.
This is an all HTML CSS project, no JS is involved! So, please style it to your liking with CSS.

Depending on how groups are doing, you will present to another group at the end of the day.

We have an instructor meeting from 12:45 to about 2, so during that time you are kind of on your own, and you can work for the rest of the day on this project and also on any exercises you want to. -->
